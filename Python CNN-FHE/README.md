To implement real encryption on the CPU side using a package, we can integrate Pyfhel for homomorphic encryption while keeping the FPGA side operations as low-level as possible. This is because the final product will have a CPU that can perform encryption using any packages, but the final FPGA must use only hardware. Therefore, all of the mathematical operations, such as the convolutional neural net, must be implemented as low level as possible for the proof of concept.
