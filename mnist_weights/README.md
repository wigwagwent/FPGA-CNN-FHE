# Project Overview

## Model Generation

This directory contains the Python code for training the MNIST model. The goal is to train the model using Python and transfer the trained weights to an FPGA for Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) computations. This enables secure and privacy-preserving machine learning inference on encrypted data.

### Getting Started

To get started with the model generation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `ModelGeneration` directory.
3. Set up a virtual environment using Python 3.x.
4. Activate the virtual environment.
5. Install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file.
6. Run the Python script to train the MNIST model.

### Dependencies

The model generation requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
